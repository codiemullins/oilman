# oilman

oilman makes it painless and easy to backup and restore a DB from the command line. It allows its user to search and choose a backup file. It will then take care of the boring stuff: setting DB to single-user mode, copying log files to the target DB, and then preparing the DB with the appropriate SQL config settings.

**WARNING**: If you currently have the SQL Backup NAS directory mounted to your Mac, oilman will unmount it and restore it to `oilman/sql_backups`

## Getting started

1. Clone this repo to your local Mac.
2. Install gems `bundle install`.
3. Create an `.env` file in the root of the oilman project folder. Specify options, example `.env` file below.
4. You can optionally install the `oilman` CLI globally. To do so, execute this command from the root directory of oilman `ln -s "$PWD/bin/oilman" /usr/local/bin/oilman`.

### Sample `.env` file

**Note**: The `DB_HOST` is used for backup and restore to determine which DB server to connect to. The `DB_NAME` is the target database which a restore should be performed on.

```
MOUNT_USER="GUEST:"
MOUNT_SERVER="192.168.14.15"

DB_USER="sql_admin"
DB_PASS="password"
DB_HOST="127.0.0.1"
DB_NAME="database"
```

## oilman help

```
Commands:
  oilman backup DATABASE  # Backup specified DATABASE
  oilman help [COMMAND]   # Describe available commands or one specific command
  oilman restore          # restore database .bak file to your target DB

Options:
  [--verbose], [--no-verbose]
```

## Creating DB Backup

Oilman makes it easy to create a DB backup, run the command `oilman backup {database_name}`.

**Sample Output**

```bash
$ oilman backup foundation_clone
Backing up database foundation_clone, this can take upto 30 minutes...
$
```

This will create a `.bak` file in the root SQL Backup NAS directory with the format of `{timestamp}_{database_name}_oilman_tmp.bak`

## Restoring DB

Oilman performs DB restores onto the database specified in the `.env` file. Using the command `oilman restore --search="foundation"`, it will search for `.bak` files matching the search string, in this instance foundation, and return directories and `.bak` files which contain the search term in their name.

**Sample Output**

```bash
$ oilman restore --search="foundation"
1. Foundation
2. 20161026162142_foundation_clone_oilman_tmp.bak
3. 20161027084021_foundation_clone_oilman_tmp.bak
Please choose your backup:  3
